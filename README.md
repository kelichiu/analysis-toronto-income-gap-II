# Higher Income Neighbourhood Have Higher Percentage Population Majoring in Specific Majors
In collaboration with [Diego Mamanche Castellanos](https://github.com/diegoarmaca)

## Summary of Findings
Education is a contributor to many beneficial socio-economic outcomes. We intend to exam the 
the relationship between academic majors and household income in Toronto's neighbourhoodsâ€”can 
we find higher or lower percentage population in certain academic majors in higher or lower 
income neighbourhoods? Choropleth maps are plotted for both household income distribution 
and academic major distribution among Toronto's neighbourhoods. The result shows that higher 
income neighbourhoods also have higher percentage of residents with majors in 'business 
management and public administration,' 'education,' and 'social and behavioural sciences 
and law.' Through a grouped bar chart that compares the academic major distribution in the 
City of Toronto and the neighbourhoods with the highest income and lowest income, we discover 
that all three groups shares a similar shape in distribution, but the scales in percentage 
drastically differ: In Bridle Path Sunnybrook York, the percentage of the population who 
have no certificate is 5.47 % higher than the percentage of the population who major in 
'business management and public administration'. In Regent Park, the percentage of the population 
who have no certificate is much higher than the percentage of the population who major in 'business 
management and public administration' by 37.31%. We intend to use the comparison to bring awareness 
of inequality in income and education existing in the City of Toronto.

## Data: City of Toronto Neighbourhood Profiles
City of Toronto Neighbourhood Profiles data set is sourced from several Census tables released by Statistics Canada every five years. The dataset uses this Census data to provide a portrait of the demographic, social and economic characteristics of the people and households in each City of Toronto neighbourhood. Each data point in this file is presented for the City's 140 neighbourhoods, as well as for the City of Toronto as a whole. The data set consists of 144 columns for neighbourhoods and 1537 rows for characteristics of the neighbourhoods. Data cleaning and reshaping are performed to have a new data frame that has 14 characteristics regarding topics of income as columns and education and the 140 neighbourhoods as rows.
